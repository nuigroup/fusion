# About
################################################################################

Fusion is a modular daemon designed to facilitate rapid prototyping of multimodal user interfaces.
It was initially written for the Natural User Interface Group as part of Google Summer of Code 2011.



################################################################################
# Features
################################################################################

* Cross-Platform
Fusion is fully cross-platform. It runs on Windows, Linux, MacOSX and FreeBSD.
The same configurations and models apply across platforms, so if your application is
cross-platform, we support it.

* Daemon
Fusion runs as a daemon process. That means you can
launch it on a different headless computer if you want (although currently some things
depend on the daemon running on localhost, and responsiveness could be an issue).

* Threading
With Fusion, you have the ability to enable threading for any module you want.
That means you are finally able to use your Core 2 Duo / Quad Core to its full
potential. Obviously, you can still use non-threaded mode.

* Remote API
Fusion has a JSON API to control all its settings and adjust your pipeline remotely
and on the fly. Interaction events are also served as JSON objects.

* HTML5 Administration
Fusion's web interface makes use of the most recent developments in web
programming with open standards like HTML5. All that is required is a compatible
HTML5 web browser. As of today, Firefox 3.6, Safari and Chromium have successfully
run the web interface.

# Compiling Fusion
################################################################################

Fusion uses the SCons build system (http://www.scons.org/). Quoting the website:
"""SCons is a software construction tool -- that is, a superior alternative to the
classic "Make" build tool that we all know and love."""

This means you have to install SCons to be able to compile Fusion.
The platform specific compile notes below include instruction on how to install
SCons. Once you have SCons installed open a command line in the Fusion directory
(the one with this README in it) and run the following command:

To build fusion (and dependencies if needed) run:
scons

To clean fusion (remove any intermediate files, output libs and executables):
scons -c  (or 'scons --clean')

To also clean the dependencies built in contrib:
scons -c --clean-contrib



For more info about SCons, other options, or how to install it on any system,
you can check the SCons user guide at:
http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Linux Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following instructions are for Ubuntu/Debian.
They should be easily transferable to other linux distributions.
Building from source on these distributions is really easy.

First, you have to install git and the build-tools:
sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential scons

Then, you get the current development version of Fusion:
git clone git://github.com/shalstvedt/Fusion.git

Afterwards, we change to the Fusion repo you just cloned:
cd Fusion

It is time to compile, let's run scons!
scons

Now you should be able to use fusion already. Try the ballworld demo:
./fusion -l config/ballworld/ballworld.cfg

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your webbrowser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Windows Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To build fusion, you will have to install a couple of things first.
You will need Visual C++ 2010 and scons (which also requires python)

1. install Visual C++ Express 2010 (not needed if you have Visual Studio 2010)
not: must be 2010 version!  you can download a free version here (select language to start download):
http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2010-Visual-CPP

2. install Python and scons
download and run the following files:
http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7/python-2.7.msi
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-2.0.1.win32.exe

OK, you're ready to build.  If you installed everything to default locations just run:
scons

If scons command is not found, try:

C:\Python2.7\Scripts\scons

Now you should be able to start fusion. Just double click the fusion executable or run it from the command line to use a config:
fusion -l config/ballworld/ballworld.cfg

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your browser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ OSX Compile Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. installl scons
download the follwoing file:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scons/scons-2.0.1.zip

2. unzip the file, open a terminal and navigate to that directory:
cd scons-2.0.1
python setup.py install

You're ready to build, just run:
scons


Note: If you need to build moved as 32bit, you can do so by forcing the -m32 flag on the compilers for both moved and all libs in contrib by running:
CC='gcc -m32' CXX='g++ -m32' scons

Now you should be able to use fusion already. Try the simple preset:
./fusion

Now that the daemon is running, you can simply open your browser
(needs to be Firefox 3.6 or some other browser with HTML5 and support for
the canvas object. Javascript has to be enabled.) and navigate to the admin interface:
http://127.0.0.1:7500/

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ Documentation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OS X or Linux:
1. Make sure you have Doxygen installed 
2. cd docs
3. make

Windows:
1. Run Doxygen on the Doxyfile in docs/
