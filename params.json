{"name":"Fusion","tagline":"Fusion â€“ a multimodal interaction framework for task-oriented and object-oriented interfaces.","body":"## Design Goals\r\nFusion is an open source, modular, cross-platform interaction framework\r\ndesigned to rapidly prototype and develop multi-modal application interfaces. It seeks to expose an easy-to-consume API for user input in multiple simultaneous input modes. Initially, we provide modules for audio input to be recognized by a grammar and Sphinx ASR, and touch/mouse input.  See [Put That There 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo) and [Put That There 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pr2KIPQOKE) for an example of multimodal interaction.\r\n\r\nSee the [Fusion page](http://ccf.nuigroup.com/2/) at the NUI Group's website for more information and a demo video. \r\n\r\nThis project was initially written for the Natural User Interface Group as part of Google Summer of Code 2011.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* __Cross-Platform__\r\nFusion is fully cross-platform. It runs on Windows, Linux, MacOSX and FreeBSD.\r\nThe same configurations and models apply across platforms, so if your application is\r\ncross-platform, we support it.\r\n\r\n* __Daemon__\r\nFusion runs as a daemon process. That means you can\r\nlaunch it on a different headless computer if you want (although currently some things\r\ndepend on the daemon running on localhost, and responsiveness could be an issue).\r\n\r\n* __Threading__\r\nWith Fusion, you have the ability to enable threading for any module you want.\r\nThat means you are finally able to use your Core 2 Duo / Quad Core to its full\r\npotential. Obviously, you can still use non-threaded mode.\r\n\r\n* __Remote API__\r\nFusion has a JSON API to control all its settings and adjust your pipeline remotely\r\nand on the fly. Interaction events are also served as JSON objects.\r\n\r\n* __HTML5 Administration__\r\nFusion's web interface makes use of the most recent developments in web\r\nprogramming with open standards like HTML5. All that is required is a compatible\r\nHTML5 web browser. As of today, Firefox 3.6, Safari and Chromium have successfully\r\nrun the web interface.\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2011 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2011](http://db.tt/JHJQ8Itn)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Scott Halstvedt\t\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Christian Moore","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
